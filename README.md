A network file sharing system based on: FTPS, HTTP, vsftpd, Nginx, Ubuntu, Reuse retired Laptop

## Why:

If I don't want to put my stuff on a cloud drive, I feel so complicated to share files because people have more than one devices nowadays and they are not based on a same platform. Plus, from my personal point of view, those companies definitely want people to buy their laptop, and cellphone, and tablet, and smartwatch from their own. That's why even they can, but they don't want customers do things easily through multiple different platforms.

First of all, I really don't like wires no matter it's usb-c, lightning or usb-micro while I'm transfering files. 

Secondly, some file accessing drive software are not user-friendly at all. They don't know how to put themselves into customers' shoes.

Besides, personally, I can't put all my photos, videos, files on one device without any backup because storage limitation, and I'm not going to pay for any clould drive. It's nothing about money. It's not safe, at least, I don't want to put my data into other's pocket.

In addtion, everybody could have a retired computer sitting somewhere covered by dust. Why don't revive it?

At last, this project could bring convinience for people who own several devices like me or for a company who wants to build its own file sharing system or for a family data backup.

For myself, this project is a self test and training.

## Aims to:

  1. Revive my retired, runable, was-a-hero, six-year-old laptop.
  2. Set up a private file sharing server, a so-called cloud storage or network file system, for sharing files from various platforms

## Tasks:

  1. Farewell Windows, Hello Linux
  2. Set up a FTPS+HTTP Server, and try to write a install&config shell script
  3. Backend: PHP or Python
  4. Frontend: Android, web, iOS

## Maybe in the future:

  1. Flow Monitoring and Analysis
  2. Distributed System
