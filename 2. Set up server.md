# Set up server

## Doing
## Somewhere I was stucked:
1. Let my server be accessible to the Internet.
  * Issue: Never try this before
  * Solution: Port Forwarding. Because I'm using router at home as everybody does.
  * P.S: Also, considering security, although personally I'm not good at it, I'm using 'iptable' to monitor the port to access and of course, never forget to use a customized port number.
