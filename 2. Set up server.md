# Set up a server

## FTP&HTTP Sever Checked.

Besides, I set up nginx to deal with more requests through HTTP for a future use, maybe using it within a company. Then this server actually becomes two parts: one uses HTTP; another one uses FTP.

Both can work with file sharing, but each has its own strength. Of course, I need application for server side and client side on next step.

## Working on FTPS now...

## Somewhere I was stucked:
1. Let my server be accessible to the Internet
    * Issue: Never try this before
    * Solution: Port Forwarding. Because I'm using router at home as everybody does.
    * P.S: Also, considering security, although personally I'm not good at it, I'm using 'iptable' to monitor the port to access and of course, never forget to use a customized port number. 
    
2. Default vim on Ubuntu
    * Issue: Direction keys and backspace are not working because of the default vim is vim-tiny
    * Solution: Remove vim-common, and install vim
